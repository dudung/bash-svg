## notes
+ `20-sep-2022` [b823d06a98](https://github.com/dudung/psh-svg/tree/b823d06a98)
  - Search for possibility of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Bash (hipersayan_x 2012), Batch (FreakCdev, 2021), and PowerShell (Saani, 2022).
  - Read the pros and cons of using SVG (Cousins, 2015) and how to begin with it through tutorial (Borbély, 2021).
  - Read how to change execution policy while test the script (Chad Miller & Neuron, 2022) \
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` \
    then set it back to its default value \
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser` \
    Choose `y` as the answer.
  - Find out that the change remains even after closing the window. It might be not good for security reason.
  - Confuse with or wihtout `.sh` extension (user280493, 2014) for Bash script.
  - With installed Git and PowerShell a Bash script can be executed as \
    `PS > bash  a-bash-script.sh` \
    after add `C:\Program Files\git\bin\` to `Path` in Windows Environment Variabels (Dewasi, 2019).
